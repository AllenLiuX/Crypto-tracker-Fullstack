    <h1>Crypto Price Tracker - Instructions</h1>
    <h3>crypto to be tracked</h3>
    <p>The is the cryptocurrecy that you want to track. You can use btc, eth, etc, stellar, or any cryptocurrency you want. If your choice is not available, you can contact me and I can try to add the crypto from the backend.</p>
    <h3>raise line and change interval</h3>
    <p>If the tracked crypto reaches the price that is above the raise line, an email will be sent to you, and the raise line will automatically add an amount of change interval.</p>
    <p>Also, the drop line will be calculated, such that when the price is below the drop line, you will also be notified, and the raise line and drop line will also be updated so that the tracked price is always between the two lines.</p>
    <h3>Tips</h3>
    <p>1. The value of interval basically decides the frequency of receiving an notification. For example, if you set the interval as 300 given that the price of btc is around 38000, you may be notified every 10-20 minutes.</p>
    <p>2. If you want to change your raise line or change interval, you don't need to cancel the subscription, but use the same crypto and email to subscribe and it will automatically update your past subcription.</p>
